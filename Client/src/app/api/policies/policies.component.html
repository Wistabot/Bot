    <h3>Long Service Award</h3>
    <p>In recognition of efforts in pursuing the work-integrated MS Software Engineering Program, every WISTAite is entitled for the Long Service Award. Long Service Award is given for accomplishing the following milestones:</p>
    <p># Club 5: On completion of 5 years at Wipro</p>
    <p># Club 10: On completion of 10 years at Wipro</p>
    <p>#Club 15: On completion of 15 years at Wipro</p>
    <p># Club 20: On completion of 20 years at Wipro</p>
    <p>LSA for Club 5 includes the 4 years tenure as a WISTA student and one year as employee. For WISTAites, where the tenure as WISTAite extends beyond 4 years, the LSA will be applicable only on completion of the WISTA program and one year of work as an employee thereafter. All members receiving the LSA are given a letter of appreciation and memento from the company. Along with this a holiday package with a wide variety of options is given to choose from. On completion of 15 &amp; 20 years at Wipro, a message is posted on Channel W as well. The process includes;</p>
    <p>All employees who complete 5, 10, 15 or 20 years are sent a congratulatory mail from the long service awards website. The URL mentioned in the mail takes employees through the various packages available for the employee to choose from. The employee views the packages available and selects the option. The Holiday Service Provider and the Wividus co-ordinator of the long service awards gets the employee's selection through e-mail automatically from the application. If the employee has chosen a holiday package, then the Holiday Service provider on receipt of the intimation from the Long Service site initiates the formalities for the holiday package. Eligible employees must ensure that they make the travel plans in advance and avail leave for using the holiday package. Eligible employees have to avail their annual leave for this purpose and would not be eligible for any additional leave.</p>
    <p>Employees should ensure to make their own arrangements to reach the resort wherever transport is not part of the package. Wherever transport is part of the package, employees would have to reach the pick- up-point and/or respective city on their own. All facilities not part of the package but availed by the employee would be payable by the employee immediately at the venue itself. The company would directly get the bill from the vendor and make payments. All packages are subject the agreement between the company and the holiday service provider. Since the cost of running the program is budgeted each year, it is difficult to keep an open ended time limit to avail of the same. We encourage you to plan your holiday well in advance so that you can avail the holiday within 6 months of reaching the milestone or within the same financial year whichever is later.</p>
    <p>The validity period of each package varies and is subject to revision at periodic intervals. Accordingly, during every revision the contents of the package and/or the package itself may be subject to changes. In case of a change in the benefits of the package the employee would avail only those benefits as is available on the day of availing the holiday at the resort. The package cannot be utilized retrospectively. For instance, if an employee completes 5 years in July and chooses to avail a package in October, assuming the package undergoes revision in September at the end of its validity period, the employee would get only those benefits as is available on the availed day of holiday. As per the IT guidelines of Sep 29, 2001, the value of any gift, or voucher, or token in lieu of which such gift may be received by the employee or by member of his household on ceremonial occasions or otherwise of worth Rs.5000/- or above shall be added as a perquisite value to the employee and subject to applicable tax rates. The worth of the holiday packages currently being provided by the company is: Rs.5000/- for Club 5, Rs.10000/- for Club 10; Rs.15000/- for Club 15 and Rs.20000/- for Club 20.</p>

    <br />

    <ol>
    <ol>

    </ol>
    </ol>
    <p>Both are valid. Only nomenclature change is recommended by UGC.</p>
    <br />
    <ol>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>If any company/ Institute does Not accept M.Tech (Information Technology) as valid degree, then whether Wipro/ VIT University are taking any responsibility for the same? And will we be getting any formal document from University?</strong></li>

    <li><strong>I am in a Data Science batch. Will it be MS in Data Science or M.Tech in Data Science?</strong></li>
    </ol>
    </ol>
    <p>All WiSTA batches (IT, Data Science, VLSI, and Engineering Design) which are getting into their Master&rsquo;s program starting April 2015 will be in M.Tech nomenclature.</p>
    <br />
    <ol>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>I am in EDS program. Will my Master&rsquo;s degree is divided into BS and MS or B.Tech and M.Tech or a single 5 year program?</strong></li>
    </ol>
    </ol>
    <p>The Masters in Engineering Design Systems is a 5-year integrated program. So, your will receive M.Tech (Engineering Design Systems) degree. There is no BS nor B.Tech before completing M.Tech.</p>
    <br />
    <ol>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>I joined WiSTA because of MS. Since the nomenclature has changed to M.Tech. I do not want to join this program. But I want to continue in Wipro as an employee. Is there an opportunity for me?</strong></li>
    </ol>
